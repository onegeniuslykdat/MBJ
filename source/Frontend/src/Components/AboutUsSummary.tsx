          {/* <p className='lead text-muted'>We are a passionate team dedicated to delivering quality experiences.</p> */}
          <p>Welcome to Mary's Joint, the heart and soul of authentic Nigerian bole, here in Australia — where roasted plantain meets perfectly grilled fish, and every bite tells a story.</p>
          <p>Born from the vibrant streets of Port Harcourt, our passion for bole goes beyond food. It’s a celebration of culture, community, and connection. We believe that food is more than sustenance — it’s a shared experience that brings people together, sparks conversations, and creates lasting memories.</p>
