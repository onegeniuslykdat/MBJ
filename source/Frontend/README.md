## Getting Started with Create React App

This project is the frontend for the FizzBuzz game, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Folder Structure
The main folder is the src folder. This comprises of:
* Components - Contains frontend jsx components
* Models - Contains model data interfaces
* Services - contains the API services to connect to the backend

There is a config.json file which contains the Url for the backend. This can be configured to suit the environment the backend is running on.
